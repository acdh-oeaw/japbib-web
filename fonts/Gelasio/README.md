Gelasio by Sorkin Type
===========================

Gelasio is an original typeface which is metrics compatible with Georgia in its Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold Italic weights. Interpolated Medium, medium Italic, SemiBold and SemiBold Italic have now been added as well. 

Gelasio supports Google Fonts Latin Pro glyph set, enabling the typesetting of English, Western, Eastern and Southern European languages as well as Vietnamese and 130+ other languages.

Note: This design will retain the purpose of being metrics compatible with Georgia in Regular and Bold weights while expanding somewhat past what Georgia can do in some areas such as having case sensitive punctuation and a few more numbers styles.

However to remain a fuctional match to Georgia it Gelasio will not include kerning.

Note that the new Georgia fornd in Windows 10 ( in 2018) has some features and glyphs not present in Gelasio such as support for Greek and Cyrillic, Small caps for all three scripts and some additional symbols, currency symbols and box drawing glyphs. Later I hope to make Gealsio fully equivalent.

I also hope to make a font based on this work with a new name that is
 - not metrics compatible with Georgia
 - is a variable font
 - has kerning
 - Is tuned to contemporary screen use rather than the relatively low resoution (72 and 96dpi) screens typical of mid-90s.

Technical Status
-------
The TTF font files here are fairly heavily tested and represent a huge improvement over previous versions. However I expect to make some fixes following feedback and after our current technical testing tool Font Bakery comes back online. I had 1-2 more minor fixes to make when Font Bakery went down. I doubt if the remaining fixes will make a difference to most users. However I do need to be clear that at least one more update to this repo should be expected. These are not final files. Please do file reports with any problems you notice in use.
